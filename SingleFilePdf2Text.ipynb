       "\"Our first question comes from Matt Olney from Stephens.   So first question, just about the overall Houston economy. Given some of the uncertainties within the economy, I'm curious what you're seeing from the competition, whether it's on the smaller community bank side or the larger regional bank side. Any change in the overall level of competition, whether it's on the loan side or on the deposit side?   I'll let Ray address this.   Matt, we've seen the -- on the loan side -- pricing has remained competitive on the loan side from the competition. On the deposit side, we've actually -- we've enjoyed some good deposit growth in the fourth quarter and have yet to see significant competition on the deposit side. But certainly, on the loan side, especially on the C&I space that -- the rates are remaining competitive. We did see 1 bank with its -- increased its rate on CDs here on the 1 year or 14 months CD... [Audio Gap] ...rights. Right. There has been 1 bank on that with time deposits.   Okay. And as I think about the Allegiance's strategy of organic loan growth from small business customers in the Houston market, any change in the strategy in 2016 given some of the uncertainties? Or is it just continuation of what you guys have done for a number of years now?   No, there's really not. We're tuned into the market. We have a lot of lenders out there in all of our offices, and they're continuing to grow their portfolios. I mean, that's really where it is for us. We have plenty of capital. We can make loans. We don't have problems to deal with in terms of asset quality. We're obviously not marred into issues dealing with oil and gas loans. So we're free to go, so to speak, in terms of making loans. There's a fair amount of continued activity in the Houston market. You've got grocery stores, I think, H-E-B and Kroger are building new stores this year. There's an air conditioning manufacturing company is building a huge facility out in the northwest part of town. So there's backfilling prior land development activity in Houston. And so lot of customers are out there, and they're still needing some good borrowings. Our guys are out there. We want to continue to stay focused in this particular sector of the market, which is that small to medium-sized business customer and provide them great service. So not -- we're not seeing any need to change to that. I think there's great opportunity for us for '16.   And last question for me. Within the loans that were identified to have some type of indirect energy exposure, I guess there's a slight increase from the last quarter. I'm curious, what was the process that you guys went through to find the additional exposure? Was it in addition -- did you widen the net that could be considered to interrupt exposure energy? Or what was that process like?   Well, we simply went back to the lenders again and rescrubbed and had each one of our lenders is the way we identify these, to identify any loan where the cash flow that's -- source of repayment has a relationship. It could be somebody who works in the industry, and we're making a loan on their residential real estate. It could be any number of things, or it could be directly to a machine shop or a company. So we had them scrub it one more time. And then, of course, we have a loan review to -- internal credit department that looks at those as well. These aren't -- this increase was not new loans made during the quarter, it was just identifying a few additional clients that we thought might have a relationship to the industry. So it's a self-identification process.   And our next question comes from Bryce Rowe from Robert W. Baird.   Couple of questions for you all, Steve, and George and Larry. The -- just curious with some of the stress that we're hearing about within the -- or with banks in that oil patch, maybe you guys could address again the opportunities for hiring and hiring of quality lenders. I know you all are always looking to add quality talent, but just any change in those prospects?   Larry, I'll let you address that. It's been good so far.   Bryce, the -- it's really stayed the same from probably the fourth quarter of the number of opportunities we have for lenders. I mean, I wouldn't say these are lenders that are coming from -- that are in the energy space from other banks that are getting out of that market. They're normal, what we call generalist-type bankers that do all types of loans, and the level of or number of folks that we're able to interview has been very steady, maybe even picked up a little bit in the last couple of weeks.   Do you want to give me your phone number?   Sure.   We hired about 6 lenders last year. We have a couple that have started already this year. And of course, there's other prospects that we're talking to. So we will -- if we get a good community lender that comes under our radar screen, we're going to go after them. It's something that -- it really is an efficient way for us to spend those dollars and get results.   That's helpful, Steven. And any plans at this point for opening de novo offices kind of associated with hiring of lending teams?   George, do you want to...   We're always looking for the opportunities to do that. And the lenders -- as you know, the way we look at it is, we want to have the team of lenders first and then we move into a market. And we are actively looking. We don't have anything yet to be able to announce.   All right, that's helpful, George. And then one question for you, Larry. You talked about the 3 pieces of the loan loss provision this quarter, one of those being the qualitative factors. So curious whether kind of the base allowance for loan loss is to loans ratio is ratcheting up as we hear about more stress within the oil patch. So just curious to kind of what directionally it will continue to see the allowance from loan losses go higher aside from the recapturing of the mark and the, I guess, the payoff of acquired loans?   So there's a lot of -- it's really hard to describe easily what's going on in the reserve. Because, as you said, there are loans that come out of the pool, the purchase pool, get renewed, and then they're considered an originated loan, and they draw a provision when your net loan balance didn't go up. It went from covered by the discount to covered by reserve. So that's kind of a hidden piece of why you need a provision. And then the qualitative factors. As you mentioned, those are broad and sometimes not driven by anything inside the bank or the bank's portfolio and economic conditions, price of oil, your peers, all those things impact our qualitative factors which we try to be very conservative with. And those impact   not just new loans, but your existing loan portfolio. So those are the kind of unknown pieces whereas you can monitor your own portfolio every quarter. Your qualitative factors all of a sudden take a jump and it had nothing to do with your portfolio.   Yes. Bryce, this is Steve. I would kind of surmise by looking at what took place in the fourth quarter is that our allowance for loan loss model is working, and it works pretty well in terms of capturing qualitative factors. We dialed those in as the data changed during -- for the quarter, and there are -- they are at pretty low levels right now. So if there's -- there could probably be some that uptick in the next quarter, some that stay where they are. I certainly can't -- I don't expect oil prices, not -- but I don't have any crystal ball on oil prices either. So we factored quite a few qualitative factors into our allowance for loan loss model, and that's really what drove a bit for the entire portfolio few basis points up in terms of reserves. So we are where the data indicates we should be right now.   Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neil.   Steve, you guys obviously did a great job growing your loan book this year. Looking into '16, it sounds like, with the new lenders, you still feel pretty good about things despite what may or may not be happening in Houston. Do you still feel good about that, maybe mid, high teen kind of loan growth rate? What in your mind may be -- we're making -- back off of that a bit or you feel a bit better about it? Do you know you can be near, closer to where you were this year?   Yes. My take on it is that we had a great fourth quarter. I think, the core loan growth just came from normal, routine production sources for us from our lenders. I don't see any reason why that would necessarily change. We've got a good pipeline going forward. We have a number of new lenders that started in '15 that are -- we're going to start building their book this year. We had -- some of our offices last year had extraordinarily robust loan growth and others didn't have much at all or even a few of them shrank. So we're shoring those shrinkage offices up and continue to have growth on the robust lending offices. So I'm feeling pretty confident about 2016 in terms of its loan growth. We don't provide guidance on that, but I don't see any reason at this particular point for our trend lines to change. Ray, do you -- how do you feel about?   I would just -- Brad, I would add that we have targeted, over the last couple of years since we've been tracking it, try to have a 50-50 mix between -- of our loan originations. So Steve had mentioned, for the fourth quarter we originated $174 million in loans that had a current balance of $111 million. And consistent with all of '15, that mix was 50 -- little bit over 50% to customers that were not here. They're new customers to the bank, and then 50%. We call that expansion of existing customers. So that, we consider to be gaining market share for that 50% of the portfolio, and that has been our track record for '15. So we feel good that, that should continue. And then as mentioned already, we do have 6 lenders that have been here less than 6 months that have yet to really get a traction, and we expect that in '16.   The Houston market is still 6 -- over 6 million people and is still expected to continue to grow over the next 10 years. So our customers are serving that entire population base, and it's retail. It's light manufacturing. It's distribution. There are a lot of products and services that our customers are handling -- actually some of them even benefit from low oil prices. So we're expecting to be able to continue to serve that particular market.   That's helpful, Steven. And this is probably not a fair question, I mean, you guys have owned the public for a short period of time, but given where the stock is right now, how do you guys -- would you guys even contemplate a share buyback or the growth opportunities you see just so great in front of you that you'd rather save the capital to kind of continue to build out. And then I know you've been active in M&A in the past, it seems organic growth is more the focus, but how do you kind of balance those kind of 3 items based on kind of how things have changed since you guys did go public?   We -- I've read about other companies that are doing share buybacks and certainly, you read that and you think about it. Our stock price has been strong until -- here in the last week or 2, there's been kind of an industry-wide decline. So these are new thoughts for us at this particular juncture. So we haven't taken the step to make a strategic determination as whether we would do that or not. I believe we've got the growth potential in our bank to utilize all of the capital that we have, and we see some real opportunities for that, particularly in the organic growth area. So I would say, it's doubtful, but it hasn't been one that our Board has considered.   We're just waiting for the blackout period [indiscernible]. Well, I'm looking to.   Our next question comes from Frank Barlow from KBW.   You all mentioned in the press release that you plan to take advantage of market segments that benefit from lower oil. And I presume some of that is from eastern Houston where petrochemical plays a large part. But can you talk a little bit about the opportunities that you're seeing, and how we should be thinking by your growth trajectory?   Now the -- we have a office down in Clear Lake that has already got kind of feet on the ground, ear to the ground on the east side of town, and they're looking at that. We also have our Gulf Freeway office that's near the port of Houston that has a number of lenders there. So we -- the East Houston Chamber of Commerce is one that we've been joined -- we've joined and are actively participating in. There's other networking opportunities. So it's going to be through just having our troops out -- feet on the ground and doing it loan by loan. Obviously, we don't -- we try to go out and do the larger development type deals, so it's going to be 1 small loan at a time. But if we are looking at new office opportunities, the east side of Houston is certainly more appealing to us today than it might have even been 2 years ago. So we're definitely scouring the landscape in eastern Houston. Ray, do you have any other color on that, that you can think of?   No, I think you got it there.   Okay. And then a follow-up there. So multi-family, are you all seeing any weakness in multi-family as of right now?   Our -- this is Ray. Our multi-family is not a significant part of the portfolio because of the space that we're in, of -- we're doing -- most of our loans are under $5 million. So the properties that we like to do are the smaller 12- to 24-unit properties, and those remain strong with occupancy. So -- and you're not going to see -- really see us in these larger multi-family deals because we just -- they're just too -- they're too big for our bank.   We ended up the year with about $45 million in multi-family dollars with 66 loans. So the average of that is well under $1 million per multi-family project. So our multi-family is pretty small in terms of average per month. So we're not looking at the larger. Now, there are a lot of multi-family units coming on stream this year and late last year in Houston. So when you read the economic reports, they indicate that there may be a slight decline in occupancy rates or even rental rates.   Okay, that's helpful. And then 1 last question. So the core margin was up a few basis points this quarter. So how should we be thinking about the core margin as we look into 2016? Should it remain fairly stable?   Yes, I think so.   Yes. It seemed to taper off. Our plan now in the fourth quarter -- so we held our own in the fourth quarter compared to the third. And with this, the Fed rate increase, the other things seem to have stabilized out. So I think it should be pretty flat going forward, any change would be very minor.   At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. George Martinez for closing remarks.   Thank you, Fern. And thank you, all, for being on the call, we appreciate. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.   Thank you, all.   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.   \""
